Finance-Bank-ID-BCA

This module provide a rudimentary interface to the web-based online banking
interface of the Indonesian "Bank Central Asia" (BCA) at
https://ibank.klikbca.com.

Warning: This module is neither offical nor is it tested to be 100% save!
Because of the nature of web-robots, everything may break from one day to the
other when the underlaying web interface changes.

WARNING

This warning is from Simon Cozens' Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB, and seems just as
apt here.

This is code for online banking, and that means your money, and that means BE
CAREFUL. You are encouraged, nay, expected, to audit the source of this module
yourself to reassure yourself that I am not doing anything untoward with your
banking data. This software is useful to me, but is provided under NO GUARANTEE,
explicit or implied.
